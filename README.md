- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GardnerRIA

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Salesforce exert on flows. I want to automate EVERYTHING. I need to created/edit/improve/transition about 20-25 flows in my org. Most are written, some need to be converted to screen, others need to be enhanced, and 3-4 need to be written. I want to automate anything and everything.

Need to add Twilio API so SMS can be sent to confirm meetings, wish happy birthday, etc, and want to bypass Twilio app for the Twilio account (if possible).

If you know Twilio, extra work there.
